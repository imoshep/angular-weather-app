    To get it on init

    public innerWidth: any;
    ngOnInit() {
        this.innerWidth = window.innerWidth;
    }
    If you wanna keep it updated on resize:

    @HostListener('window:resize', ['$event'])
    onResize(event) {
      this.innerWidth = window.innerWidth;
    }

    this.innerWidth = event.target.innerWidth; ... is possibly more efficient, produces the same result – danday74 Nov 12 '18 at 8:47

    Also recommend this in the constructor if you are using lodash ... this.onResize = debounce(this.onResize, 150, {leading: false, trailing: true}) ... to prevent the onResize method being called too frequently ... you will need to ... import { debounce } from 'lodash' – danday74 Nov 12 '18 at 8:53
    I think preferred to use ngAfterViewInit life hook method instead of ngOnInit life hook method
